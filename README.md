# Overall Goal

Overall, we want to create a great experience for the team over at SuperSocial. With this demo, we plan to execute a basic tutorial (how the game will open) so that they can see the basic user experience we are aiming for.

*While most of our notes are on notion, we're comprising some of those ideas here for what we are aiming for when it comes down to the demo.*

---

# What the SuperSocial Team should expect

SuperSocial should expect:

- Loading into the game, being greeted by an NPC that will walk you through what the game is all about, will show you around in regards to your studio, explain that there is a shop (not contained in demo), and will explain other features inside of the game.
- After all of the important information has been said, the NPC will show a sign of shock, and say "Oh no! There's a customer here already? We're not set up yet!" which will ensue the tutorial.
- Players will place down a waiting room (area) chair, a secretary (sign-in) desk, hair washing station, and a haircutting station.
- Upon finishing those tasks, the NPC will come back on-screen, and say: "Whoo! That was a close one, let's go greet the customer!"
- Path will be revealed showing you where the customer is (they are waiting at the door). You'll welcome in the customer, and will check them in.
- After being checked in they will sit down in the waiting room until you call for them (walk up to them and press E key). ...(NPC will explain that they wait in the waiting room in the event all seats are filled).
- The player will then take them to the hairwashing station, and handle that task by pressing E.
- The NPC will then walk over the barber chair, and will sit down and get their hair cut, dried, etc.
- NPC will pay, and leave.

After tutorial is finished, this loop will continue infinitely.
